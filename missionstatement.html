                <h2><em>The MIND is not a vessel to fill but a fire to kindle.</em></h2>

                <br>

                <p>This is exactly why we are named My FIRST as we believe every step in life should always be treated as our first!</p>

                <br>

                <p>Our research shows OSMOSIS as the best form of knowledge transfer by overhauling teaching and learning; 
                    taking advantage of this new methodology where emphasis is not on teaching but enabling learning.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>Education should be all about devoted individuals enabling learning and inducing teaching. Communicating
                    and exchanging ideas are most important in the process of teaching and learning. Simply put, OSMOSIS
                    is the process by which learning and understanding is gradually carried out without much fan fare or
                    even much notice. It is a natural process of absorption suggestive of the flow of knowledge in an especially
                    effortless often unconscious assimilation. It is movement of content through which the knowledge imbalance
                    equalizes by diffusion of the more concentrated to the lesser in a slow, gradual and inconspicuous pace.</p>

                <h2><em>Status Quo is unacceptable, so STEP UP</em></h2>

                <br>

                <p>Revamp of the current education is necessary and monumental change is on the horizon, owing to the digital
                    sophistication or ubiquitous simplification that demanded upmost urgency. Proliferation of digital tools
                    are gaining foothold industry wide, requiring digital and coding skills that encompasses all areas of
                    businesses that used to be purely language; written form or spoken otherwise.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Today, imagery whether still or moving, are combined by sound tracks or music that work as backdrop to endow
                    the written and spoken literature with dimensions that enhances sound and sight. Yet all tools enhancing
                    audio and visual experiences require understanding of the intricate design of cyberspace and architectural
                    landscape of the cloud.  BIG DATA are diagnosed and analyzed to further statistical evidence of behavorial sciences.</P>

                <h2><em>Cyberspace catapults Learning into Quantum Leap</em></h2>

                <br>

                <p>Internet has fasten the pace of knowledge accumulation and information transfer upon the shoulders of our
                    forefathers and them upon theirs. The miraculous combined knowledge going back to the early years of papyrus to 
                    modern literature on paper, is fascinating.  Yet this monumental precipitation of data pales in comparison to the 
                    explosion of instantaneous information on the Internet, where knowledge is no longer bounded by geographical limitations, 
                    language barriers, and even accessibility constraints.</P>

                <br>

                <p>This new era where colossal data base lies within the reach of each and every individual by the finger-tip,
                    opens up possibilities unforeseen in the history of mankind. All-encompassing information access at warp
                    speed is an achievement that is even greater than traditional ways of collective learning. Learning is now 
                    instantaneous and immensely content intensive, thanks to modern-day technological advances and proliferation of 
                    web and mobile platforms where anything and everything are exchanged and communicated.</p>
